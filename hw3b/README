This submission contains a Makefile, this README, and a single C++ source file
lab3b.cpp. This is assignment is full of hacks, unnecessary data structures,
unreadable code, overcomplications, oversimplifications, inefficiency, special
cases, and otherwise lots of bullshittery, but damnit it passes the sanity check
and I'm graduating in 3.5 weeks so I'm calling it good enough.

Also this is a day late because HMC had no classes Monday and Tuesday so I took
the liberty of being lazy. I belive this is the first slip day I have used.

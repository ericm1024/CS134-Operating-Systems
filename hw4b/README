My code uses ppoll(2) to wait on standard in and the sysfs file for the
button's GPIO pin. This is inspired by the the mraa library's implementation
of interrupt handlers. To be clear, I heavily referenced their source code,
found here:

https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa/blob/master/src/gpio/gpio.c

The code is otherwise non-remarkable.

I did not implement a smoke check test because I am lazy/it seemed like more
effort than it was worth.

FILES

This submission includes the following files:

    Makefile: My build script for this assignment.

    gdb_confirm_null_ptr.png: a screenshot of a gdb session confirming that
    the dereferenced pointer is ineed null

    gdb_segfault_backtrace.png: a screenshot of a gdb session showing a
    backtrace of the segfault.

article about the tar utility.

SMOKE TEST

My "smoke test" for the lab is a short bash script (called simply "test") that
runs the lab0 executable with a variety of arguments and inputs and ensures that
the return values and outputs are as expected.

LIMITATIONS

The lab0 program does not handle short writes (e.g. a call to write(2) that
writes less bytes than asked). The decision was made not to handle short
writes because I don't know how to test them on regular files, and that
kind of robustness seemed a excessive for this assignment.
